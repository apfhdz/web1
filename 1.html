<h2>My records of learning coding</h2>
<em>since 2021</em>
<p>Today, I <strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" target="_blank" title="html15 specification">restart</a> learning coding again.</strong> I'm 29 years old in 2021 now, and I want to change my life desperately. Hope it'll be better than before.</p>

<p>There's many reasons what I've thought like this. First, the music field is too small and inaccessible. It seems like for people who are really rich so that make common people not to try. Second, it has to make an effort too much. Long time ago, it worked when someone finished studying music, but these days it doesn't work anymore. I've to find some other field or work I can earn money. Third, my life is so long and has many possiblities. I must challenge something for me. That's why I restart this today. This site has so many useful free lectures! I have no reasons that I don't try.</p>
